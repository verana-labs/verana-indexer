# DID History Service

The **DID History Service** is responsible for recording all lifecycle changes
(add, renew, touch, remove) of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and allowing
clients to query historical data for a given DID.

---

## üì¶ How it works
1. Incoming DID-related blockchain messages are processed by
   `DidMessageProcessorService`.
2. For each message:
   - The current DID state is **upserted** in the `DidDatabaseService`.
   - A **history record** is created and persisted through
     `DidHistoryService.save()`.
3. This creates an append-only audit trail of all DID changes over time.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Saved

Each DID history record includes:

- `did` ‚Äî DID identifier string.
- `controller` ‚Äî Current controller of the DID.
- `deposit` ‚Äî Deposit amount associated with the DID.
- `exp` ‚Äî Expiration date of the DID.
- `created` ‚Äî Initial creation timestamp.
- `changes` ‚Äî JSON object describing differences compared to previous record.
